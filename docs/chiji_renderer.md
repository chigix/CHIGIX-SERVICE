CHIJI Engine : Just Enjoy Front-end
======================================

## OVERVIEW

Originally,it should be asserted that this engine just goals for accelerating the making of the template files. In another word, this is only a tool for building view quickly and easily.

There is no any altering for the view layer.

The key point of the CHIJI Engine's design is to make the deployment service oriented for the templates and front-end resources.

## Automatic Deployment for the Template files

CHIJI Engine goals for the basic deployment to simplify the arrangement in the view. Therefore developers could possess a series of files for front-end to be modified rather than to be making from the beginning.

### @todo

1. Make an empty template file matching up with the action address `Module/Action` .
2. Write down a string `@todo` in the file created just now without new lines.
3. Try to display this template in the brwoser and you will see the motivating result on the screen:

		欢迎使用千路前端

4. Return to the todo file just created, you will see all.

### @module

## Accellerate the JS developing
